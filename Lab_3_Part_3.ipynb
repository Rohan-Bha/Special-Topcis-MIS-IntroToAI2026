        "Abstract:\n",
        "Artificial intelligence is being integrated into healthcare settings at an accelerating pace.\n",
        "A 2024 review of 42 peer-reviewed studies found that AI diagnostic tools demonstrated\n",
        "a mean accuracy improvement of 14% over baseline clinician performance in radiology tasks.\n",
        "However, 67% of studies reported bias in AI systems against underrepresented racial groups,\n",
        "with false-negative rates up to 23% higher for Black patients in dermatology applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "1. AI-powered early detection systems reduced late-stage cancer diagnoses by 19% in pilot hospitals.\n",
        "2. Administrative AI tools (scheduling, billing) reduced hospital overhead costs by an average of $1.2M per year.\n",
        "3. Clinician trust in AI recommendations was low (38% adoption rate) unless explainability features were included.\n",
        "4. Regulatory frameworks lag significantly behind deployment: only 12% of AI tools in use had FDA clearance.\n",
        "5. Rural hospitals showed the highest potential benefit but the lowest adoption due to infrastructure gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendations:\n",
        "The authors recommend mandatory bias audits for all clinical AI tools before deployment,\n",
        "investment in AI literacy training for clinicians, and policy reform to expedite FDA review\n",
        "processes without sacrificing safety. The paper calls for equity-centered AI development\n",
